# Faster-R-CNN-Object-Detection-for-Cardboard-Boxes-
# Description
In this study, we look at the idea of assisting parcel processing by automating the 2D detection of parcels. Deep learning models such as Faster R-CNN have been used to derive features of the parcel and to recognize all the occurrences of an object category. 

A Convolutional Neural Network method is applied here for the environment to assign importance to various aspects in the image after taking in an input image. We are installing Detectron2 dependencies here to set up the programming environment to be ready to carry out an object detection task. In this training, we will be using Faster R-CNN as our object detection base model with R101-FPN as a baseline. The dataset used in the training is annotated in a COCO JSON format which is favorable for Faster R-CNN. The computer vision model is extracted from roboflow.com and model zoo Detectron 2 using Faster R-CNN is used.

# Dataset
The Cardboard boxes dataset was extract from an online source: https://medium.com/@ringlayer/cardboard-box-detection-using-retinanet-keras-5d4f331d9d15 and is preprocess via Roboflow.
